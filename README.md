# liri-node-app

## Use LIRI to search for concert information, look up song/album info, and search for movie info!

**Packages required to use LIRI:**
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs

## LIRI can take in the following commands:
` concert-this <artist/band name here>`
` spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`
` movie-this '<movie name here>'`
` do-what-it-says`


**Example:** `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'` will output (in your Terminal/bash window):
* Artist(s)
* The song's name
* A preview link of the song from Spotify
* The album that the song is from

`do-what-it-says` takes a command from an external file (random.txt), and outputs the result based on what is listed in the file.
